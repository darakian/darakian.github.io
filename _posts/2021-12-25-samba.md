# Time off and new toys
I recently got myself a raspbeery pi in trade for a sauce pan and had to come up with a use for it and struggled to figure out how to get a basic samba share going. I used to do this sort of thing for a living and thought this would be a simple exercise in memory recall. It was not.  

## Network shares
I'm working with a Fedora server 35 setup which comes with a per-user home share, but I wanted to share out an attached disk with full world read/write. Not high security I know, but highly usable and access is limited via firewalld. Anyway, I began with a basic open config 

```
[Public]
	Comment = A public share for the world to write to
	writeable = yes
	public = yes
	browsable = yes
	path = /home/jon/Share_Dir
```
Get samba running (and running on boot) with 
`systemctl enable smb; systemctl start smb`
and I'm left with a share that I can connect to, but which is empty. The disk itself wasn't empty and I could see my files sitting there when I ssh'd in. I played with file permissions, users permissions, and all sorts of snake oil config options I found all over the web. The catch? SELinux. The last time I set this up SELinux was still fairly nascent. Turns out SELinux has things to say about samba shares. Thankfully the fix is fairly straight forward. New to me but there's a command line utility `chcon` to change the SELinux context of a file or folder and a context type `samba_share_t` which I need to apply. In my case `chcon -R -t samba_share_t /home/jon/Share_Dir`. Applying that tells SELinux that you do indeed want to share out your target directory (and everything in it).

```
